# WeatherApplicationwithclientandserverAPI-Integration
Welcome to my Weather App project! This app integrates client and server APIs to provide real-time weather updates based on city names. Built on Salesforce Lightning Web Components (LWC) and Apex, the app uses an API key for authentication and includes built-in API requests to fetch weather data.
